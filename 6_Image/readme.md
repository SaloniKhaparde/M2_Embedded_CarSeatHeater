## Overview

Objective is to make a Car Seat Heater. The whole project is divided into four different activities.

Activity 1
To check the status of passenger whether seated or not and show the status, then to check whether heater is on or not. If both the conditions are satisfied the LED will glow.

Activity 2
To take the ADC value of temperature sensor as input to microcontroller.

Activity 3
To display the temperature by showing output PWM through CRO.

Activity 4
To show the temperature input to CAN module, which shows the temperature values gone to protocol.

Simulation Schematic and Output

Case 1: When Button Sensor Switch or Heater Switch or both are OFF

Case 2: When Button Sensor Switch is ON and Heater Switch is OFF
